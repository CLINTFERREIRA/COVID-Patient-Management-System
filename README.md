# PYTHON-PROJECT
### Working
COVID-19 Patient Management System - We have created this database project using python with a interactive user interface for an hospital in which they can store all the Covid-19 patients record in a well defined manner and track the records of each patient. We have used Tkinter for user interface and MySQL database for storing patient data. The Hospital staff can add new Patient, Delete Record, Update Existing Patients and View all the patient records. It also displays a total patients infected counter on the home screen.
